## cyberblast/screeps.feature.foundation

This is a feature extension for the [screeps engine repository](https://github.com/cyberblast/screeps.engine).

Basic foundation to get screeps up & running.  
Analyzes rooms, flags & creeps & triggers events.  
Serves as basis for higher features.  
May get reduced (split up to separate features) in the future.
